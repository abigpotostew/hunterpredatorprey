Played three times. Kept remarking she was bad at games. When asked, she said that the AI worked pretty well. There were few glitches and no breakages. Noted that the lion was relatively hard to kill. Also noticed that Deer flocked well. When asked, she concluded that the game was more fun and interesting with behavior states than it would have been with just plain chasing or hiding.

Made plenty of comments on the beautiful art. Noted multiple times on the relative intelligence of the Lion AI. Tried more often to kill the lion than deer. Also liked that there were behaviors rather than just repeated actions. Said that the lion seemed intelligent/complex. Said that he liked the relative difficulty of the game (the lion was particuarly hard to kill for him). Couldn't stop laughing at the weird-looking Wander behavior.
