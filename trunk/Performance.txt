Performance:
	As for speed, we had no direct way of measuring how long each individual AI piece took to update. However, to account for this setback, we changed the framerate of our game to test performance impact. By default our game runs at 60 fps. At 100 frames per second, the game did not lag at all. At this rate, the game has 10 milliseconds per frame to update all the AI. Increasing the framerate to 500 fps sped up the gameplay, but also had no performance impact. At 500fps all of the AI has 2 milliseconds up update. Continuing, at 1000fps the game has 1ms to update all AI each frame. The game showed small signs of lag, but for the most part it still ran. This mean that each frame, our AI updates and executes in less than or equal to 1 millisecond. Normally AI is a small part of a larger game. I'd assume that 1ms is a reasonable amount of time dedicated to AI. In conclusion, our AI is efficient.
