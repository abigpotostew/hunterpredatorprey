DIRECTIONS:

You play as the hunter, WASD to move, J to stab, and K to throw

You can kill the deer and eat them to regain health, the lion will be hunting
the deer or you depending on the situation, it also heals when it eats a deer.

The lion can and will kill you (no reset button sorry) and you can kill
the lion (although it will take you a few tries).

All of our code is within Steering/Steering/Steering/
In there you will see the FSM folder containing all the 
finite machine code, each in its own .cs file and folder

The best way to open all the code is to open the solutions file with
visual studio or C# studio express
(We would heavily recommend
one of those programs to open the code if you dont have it already
because otherwise the code is hard to see all together). 

EXECUTABLE FILE IS LOCATED AT:

 Steering/Steering/Steering/bin/x86/Release/Steering.exe

Sorry for the hidden exe file, this is how visual studios likes it
(and we dont like one click install thing its weird)

Please if anything goes wrong (like you can't find something)
let use know and we will fix it promptly, Thank You
